# LeafCounter

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@spalshzzz](https://github.com/spalshzzz) and [@matheusnunesismael](https://github.com/matheusnunesismael) in 2020.

This project was an assignment for the Digital Image Processing class we took in our 3th year of Computer Science.

Coded in Python, it does image segmentation from a set of files provided by the class's professor. We segment leaves from these images and save them in separate files, creating a CSV with information about each leaf and the Freeman Chain of each one.
